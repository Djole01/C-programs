# C-programs
 
 A couple of C programs I made during system software course.
 
 I will add more when I produce better code, currently I am working on embedded linux development,
 remote debugging with a raspberry pi. I am bound to write some code in C/C++ for that, and upload it here.

Went back and saw that one program from Uni had a nasty bug. It got stuck in a while loop if the user entered a wrong input. 
I have fixed that now with recursive functions that ask for the input, however I didn't bother to implement datatype checking
for this simple program.
